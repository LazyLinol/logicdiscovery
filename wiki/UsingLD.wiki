#summary How to use Logic Discovery

= Client software =

To get something useful you'll need logic analyzer client running on PC.
Theoretically any SUMP compatible app will do. I'm using [http://www.lxtreme.nl/ols/ Logic Sniffer]

= Board =

By default LD uses port D as it's data source. Triggers can be configured by client software to use any edge on any pin, sampling can also be triggered by pressing user button (blue one).

STM32F4Discovery board powered from STLink port (mini-USB), but in order to use LD you'll have to connect it to your PC using micro-USB port. To power board from micro-USB and get rid of a second cable connect PA9 pin to 5V pin on P2 connector. PA9 is wired directly to the micro-USB's VBus, and 5V pin is wired to the LDO's input.
